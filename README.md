Week 10 Assignment:
Using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript create a single page website that contains the following:
    A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
    A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

For this I enabled someone to add the albums in their music collection by genre (Pop, Rock, Metal, etc.), using the 
album artist's name and the album title.
